Description: An implementation of zero-dimensional ecohydrological models in a
    2D framework which allows interaction with lateral groundwater flow. The 
	original functions were published in Vervoort and van der Zee (2008; 2009;
	2012) except for the groundwater component, which is currently unpublished.
