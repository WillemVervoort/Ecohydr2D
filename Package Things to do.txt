Package Ecohydr2D things to do:
1. Move current examples to a different directory (not synced with Bitbucket)
2. Create a very simple example that does not need GWT.exe for 10 grid cells
3. Create a second example that uses GWT.exe, but only for 10 grid cells and a simple river/BC
4. Write the help files for all the functions
5. fork bitbucket to keep a separate development copy
